## üìã Abstract

Accurate parameter estimation in electrochemical battery models is essential
for monitoring and assessing the performance of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs).
This paper presents a novel approach that combines deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) with an optimal experimental design (OED) framework to identify key
electrochemical parameters of LiB cell models. The proposed method utilizes the
twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm to optimize
input excitation, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the system response to
electrochemical parameters. The performance of this DRL-based approach is
evaluated against a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method and
conventional tests. Results indicate that the DRL-based method provides
superior information content, reflected in higher Fisher information (FI)
values and lower parameter estimation errors compared to the NMPC design and
conventional test practices. Additionally, the DRL approach offers a
substantial reduction in experimental time and computational resources.
