## 📋 Abstract

Representation learning methods are an important tool for addressing the
challenges posed by complex observations spaces in sequential decision making
problems. Recently, many methods have used a wide variety of types of
approaches for learning meaningful state representations in reinforcement
learning, allowing better sample efficiency, generalization, and performance.
This survey aims to provide a broad categorization of these methods within a
model-free online setting, exploring how they tackle the learning of state
representations differently. We categorize the methods into six main classes,
detailing their mechanisms, benefits, and limitations. Through this taxonomy,
our aim is to enhance the understanding of this field and provide a guide for
new researchers. We also discuss techniques for assessing the quality of
representations, and detail relevant future directions.
