## üìã Abstract

Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution information to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The efficiency depends on accurately identifying the current task. This research proposes SimBelief‚Äîa novel meta-RL framework that measures similarity of task belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDPs (BAMDPs). Inspired by bisimulation metrics, SimBelief extracts common features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification and exploration in sparse reward environments by learning latent dynamics across task distributions.

## üîç Key Findings

### **1. Task Belief Similarity Framework**
- Successfully extracts common structural features across similar tasks in latent space
- Enables rapid task identification by recognizing shared patterns (like pulling actions for opening windows vs. drawers)
- Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym tasks
- Demonstrates superior adaptability to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks

### **2. Latent Dynamics Learning**
- Learns reward model, transition model, and inverse dynamics model in latent space
- Combines latent task belief similarity with specific task belief for enhanced adaptability
- Avoids loss of crucial detailed information that purely latent approaches suffer from
- Maintains convergence to Bayesian optimal policy

### **3. Sparse Reward Performance**
- Particularly effective in environments with sparse or uninformative rewards
- Leverages shared structures to guide exploration when rewards are minimal
- Demonstrates stronger generalization capabilities compared to existing methods

## üìä Significance

SimBelief represents a significant advancement in meta-reinforcement learning by providing a principled framework for measuring and leveraging task similarity. The integration of bisimulation metrics with Bayes-Adaptive MDPs offers a robust theoretical foundation while demonstrating practical improvements in challenging sparse reward environments.

The work's emphasis on learning shared structures across tasks addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: how to efficiently transfer knowledge between related but distinct problems. This has broad implications for developing more adaptable and efficient AI systems that can leverage prior experience for rapid learning in new domains.

The superior performance on out-of-distribution tasks particularly highlights the framework's potential for real-world deployment where test conditions may differ from training scenarios.
