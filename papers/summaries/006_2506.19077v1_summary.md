## üìã Abstract

With a growing number of robots being deployed across diverse applications,
robust multimodal anomaly detection becomes increasingly important. In robotic
manipulation, failures typically arise from (1) robot-driven anomalies due to
an insufficient task model or hardware limitations, and (2) environment-driven
anomalies caused by dynamic environmental changes or external interferences.
Conventional anomaly detection methods focus either on the first by low-level
statistical modeling of proprioceptive signals or the second by deep
learning-based visual environment observation, each with different
computational and training data requirements. To effectively capture anomalies
from both sources, we propose a mixture-of-experts framework that integrates
the complementary detection mechanisms with a visual-language model for
environment monitoring and a Gaussian-mixture regression-based detector for
tracking deviations in interaction forces and robot motions. We introduce a
confidence-based fusion mechanism that dynamically selects the most reliable
detector for each situation. We evaluate our approach on both household and
industrial tasks using two robotic systems, demonstrating a 60% reduction in
detection delay while improving frame-wise anomaly detection performance
compared to individual detectors.
